# Learning and working with ES6 / ES2015
To work with ES6 today in a real world enviroment, there is a lot of tooling that is required to compile/"source-to-source" the ES6 into ES5 to make sure it works.

That means that today, ES6 is effectively syntastical sugar. What we write is not what is read by the client. The Client gets the compiled ES5, meanwhile we work with ES6 syntax.

## Advantages of ES6 enviroment
ES6 is the next step in webdevelopment with javascript. It introduces new managment of variables, and nicer more readable syntax while also giving us tools to easier handle our data in a more straightforward way.
